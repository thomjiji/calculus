## Riemann sums

A Riemann sum is an approximation of the ares under a curve by dividing it into multiple
simple shapes (like rectangles or trapezoids).

- Left Riemann sums
- Right Riemann sums

### Overestimation and underestimation

| Direction  | Left Riemann sum | Right Riemann sum |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Increasing | Underestimation  | Overestimation    |
| Decreasing | Overestimation   | Underestimation   |

## Trapezoidal sum

We call any approximation that uses rectangles a Riemann sum, and any approximation that
uses trapezoids a trapezoidal sum.
