### The power of a power rule

$$ (a^m)^n = a^{m \times n} $$

### Secant

$$ \sec(x) = \frac{1}{\cos(x)} $$

### General form property of exponents

The general form property of exponents is defined as follows:

$$a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a^m}$$

So you can write $\sqrt[5]{x^3}$ as $x^{\frac{3}{5}}$.
