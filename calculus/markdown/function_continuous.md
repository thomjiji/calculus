### Under what conditions can a function be considered continuous?

A function f(x) is considered continuous at a point x=a if the following conditions are 
all met:

- Defined: The function f(x) is defined at x=a. Meaning you can substitute a into the 
function and get a real number.

- Limit Exists: The limit of the function as x approaches a exists. This means that as 
x gets closer and closer to a from either direction, f(x) approaches some specific value 
L.

- Function Equals Limit: The value of the function at a is equal to the limit of the 
function as x approaches a. In other words, f(a) = L.

The function f(x) is said to be continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every 
point in that interval. It is said to be continuous everywhere or simply continuous if 
it is continuous at every point over its entire domain.

So, Mathematically, A function f(x) is continuous at x = a if 
$$\lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) = f(a)$$
Or more explicitly, it is continuous at x = a if 
$$\lim_{{x \to a^-}} f(x) = f(a) = \lim_{{x \to a^+}} f(x)$$
Where lim{x->a^-} f(x) is the limit as x approaches a from the left, f(a) is the 
function value at a, and lim{x->a^+} f(x) is the limit as x approaches a from the right. 
If all three of these quantities are the same, then f(x) is continuous at x = a.
